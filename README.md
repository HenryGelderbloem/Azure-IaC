# Project Description
---
I created this DevOps Project as a space to learn more about Azure and Azure DevOps. I will either be documenting or scripting the process, or both. 

# Documentation
---
In my quest to learn as much of Azure as I can I am going to define how to deploy Azure resource and configurations in four formats, ARM (JSON), Azure CLI, and PowerShell. I will format each file to closely follow the Azure Portal in terms of order and options to make it easy to read and to translate between different languages.
