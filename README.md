# Project Description
---
I created this DevOps Project as a space to learn more about Azure and Azure DevOps. I will either be documenting or scripting the process, or both. 

# Documentation
---
In my quest to learn as much of Azure as I can I am going to define how to deploy Azure resource and configurations in four formats, ARM (JSON), Azure CLI, PowerShell and finally Terraform. I will format each file to closely follow the Azure Portal in terms of order and options to make it easy to read and to translate between different languages, so if you are learning like me, you may appreciate that work and I try to make use of comments where supported to explain everything that I am scripting.

# Contributions

Please feel free to submit a pull request to make a change to anything on this project. Please use comments and detail why you feel a change should be made, I'm still learning after all.
